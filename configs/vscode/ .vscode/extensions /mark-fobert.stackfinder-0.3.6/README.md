# StackFinder

StackFinder makes it easy to find what you're looking for on Stack Overflow without having to go into your broswer. The process is seamless. Type what you want to search for in the editor you're working in and hit:

```
CTRL+ENTER
CMD+ENTER [MAC]
````

You will be instantly presented with a (hopefully) relevant stackoverflow question and answer where you have the option to paste code snippets directly to the editor, switch between questions, view the original source in your default browser, and more.

The motivation behind this development was to make it as seamless as possible to get solutions into your code. Instead of having 100 chrome/firefox tabs open with different stackoverflow pages up, you can have one open in your code editor. This saves a little time every search, but given how much us developers do this, it can add up to some substantial time savings while keeping you in your coding zone.
